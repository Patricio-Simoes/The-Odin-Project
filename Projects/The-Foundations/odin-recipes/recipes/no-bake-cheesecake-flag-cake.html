                <h2>Description:</h2>
                <p>That you can make this lovely, sweet treat without turning on the oven is probably enough of a reason
                    to give this serious consideration. Besides the taste and light mousse-like texture, I think your
                    guests will enjoy the iconic stars and stripes design provided by the fresh blueberries and
                    strawberries. USA! USA! USA!</p>

                <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Step 1:</h4>
                        <p>Combine graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup sugar, cocoa powder, and melted butter in a bowl until
                            mixture is thoroughly combined and crumbly. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Step 2:</h4>
                        <p>Transfer crust mixture to a 9x11-inch baking dish. Press crust into bottom of dish until
                            smooth and even. Cover dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set, about 30 minutes.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Step 3:</h4>
                        <p>Mix cream cheese and mascarpone cheese in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Stir in lemon
                            zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract into mixture. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Step 4:</h4>
                        <p>Whisk 1/3 cup sugar into whipping cream in a separate metal or glass bowl until the cream is
                            fluffy and forms soft peaks. Add whipped cream to the cream cheese mixture and gently whisk
                            until filling is soft, fluffy, and well combined. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Step 5:</h4>
                        <p>Spoon filling on top of the graham cracker crust, spreading and smoothing the top. Tap the
                            pan gently on a work surface several times to settle the crust and filling. Cover pan
                            tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled and set, at least 3 hours. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Step 6:</h4>
                        <p>Continue to make strawberry stripes, starting about 3/4 inch up from the bottom stripe and
                            laying down 3 more stripes stretching the full length of the cake. Make 1 more line of
                            strawberries beneath the short stripe to leave a square space for the blue field of stars.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Step 7:</h4>
                        <p>Lay a line of blueberries with the blossom ends pointing up in the upper left square space.
                            Continue to lay down blueberries in lines, berries touching the previous line, until the
                            square is filled with blueberries. Cut cake into squares to serve. </p>
