<h1>Project Summary:</h1>

- This project aims to build a dimensionable grid that allows the user to paint each cell with custom colors.
- The grid itself is built with javascript and is adjustable anytime to the user's liking.
- The project's theme is a 'Tux theme', mainly because i like Linux and decided to have some fun :)

<h1>Project Structure:</h1>

- The project was built with HTML, CSS & JS.
- There is only one HTML page, 'home.html', there is one CSS stylesheet, 'styles.css' and a media queries stylesheet, 'media.css', finally there are three JS scripts:
    - 'document.js' - This is where the HTML elements are fetched from the DOM and stored in JS variables;
    - 'app.js' - This is where the JS login is implemented;
    - 'events.js' - This is where the events are triggered and somehow it is an extension to 'app.js'.
